## Feedback
<p>I prefer to receive feedback: face to face</p>
<p>If you are going to correct me: do it privately </p>
<p>If you are going to tell me I'm doing something wrong, phrase it this way:just tell me what im doing wrong</p>
<p>If you want to praise me: i don't care</p>
<p>It is important to me that feedback is: includes specific examples </p>
